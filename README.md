# eosjs 

## Proposal

Node and browser general purpose library.  This will combine other libraries into a larger package to allow for easy programming of blockchain read and write operations.

* [libtx](https://github.com/eosjs/libtx) - serialize operations that update the blockchain
* [libsign](https://github.com/eosjs/libstore) - private key signing and security lib for wallet implementations
* [json](https://github.com/eosjs/json) - blockchain definitions (api method names, blockchain operations, etc)
